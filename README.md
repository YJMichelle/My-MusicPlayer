# My MusicPlayer

* I have created my own service MyService then overridden three methods i.e. onStartCommand, onBind and onDestroy.
* MediaPlayer is a build-in class in Android.
* I placed two button okay and stop, when you click on okay button then the music will start and when you click on stop button music will stop.

* Service -> application component that can perform long-running operations in the background.
* Service need to be first register at manifest file
